# Gantry_controller

## About the Project
In collaboration with Dunkermotoren, students from the linkit university group have developed a robot system for trade fairs that demonstrates the interaction of computer vision and highly dynamic linear actuators.

Randomly moved small chocolate bars of different flavours are recognised and handed over to the trade fair visitor with a gantry gripping system.
